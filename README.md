# nvtk_mp4_to_gpx
Python script for extracting GPS data from Novatek .mp4 files

This script is based on original script file from Sergei at https://sergei.nz/extracting-gps-data-from-viofo-a119-and-other-novatek-powered-cameras/ with my little modifications (parse many files/directory at once and combile at one output .gpx file).
